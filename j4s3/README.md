# Java Client for Amazon S3

A simple Java application illustrating usage of the AWS SDK for Java.

## Requirements

The only requirement of this application is Maven. All other dependencies can
be installed by building the maven package:
    
    mvn package

## Basic Configuration


    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = <your access key id>
    aws_secret_access_key = <your secret key>

See the [Security Credentials](http://aws.amazon.com/security-credentials) page
for more information on getting your keys.

## Running the S3 sample

This sample application connects to Amazon's [Simple Storage Service (S3)](http://aws.amazon.com/s3),
creates a bucket, and uploads a file to that bucket. The code will generate a
bucket name for you, as well as an example file to upload. 
    

When you start making your own buckets, the S3 documentation provides a good overview
of the [restrictions for bucket names](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/BucketRestrictions.html).
